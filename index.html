    <h3>Recycled.</h3>
  <p>Each candle is individually poured in a recycled glass jar that is 100% recyclable and can be recycled and reused endlessly without loss in quality. Glass with virtually no chemical interaction ensures that our candles maintain their strength and aroma. Our box is made with tree-free paper and printed with soy ink.</p>

 <div class="natural">  
    <h3>Natural.</h3>
  <p> Made only with ingredients from organic farms, our coconut wax candles are totally natural because they are made out of raw products. The natural material burns a lot cleaner and cooler. Our eco-friendly candles also use 100% unbleached natural cotton wicks. The wick is designed specifically to burn best in organic wax candles for an even glow and pure burn. </p>

 <div class="sustainable">  
    <h3>Sustainable.</h3>
  <p>Unlike ordinary candles, we produce candles with no animal byproducts, petroleum, or artificial scents. Our candles are made from coconut wax which makes our product organic, sustainable, and eco-friendly. Coconut is considered by many as the best wax used in candles due to the fact that coconut is a renewable resource and the wax is naturally bio-degradable. Plant-based wax is less wasteful but still makes for a high-quality candle.</p>

  <h1>our beginnings</h1>
  <p>Due to an increase in medical issues, our founder Aleicia LaClaire began to research ways to rid her surroundings of toxic materials. Lighting candles has always been part of her nighttime routine, but the harmful perfumes were having an effect on her health. Turns out that traditional candles are full of toxic chemicals, like petroleum, dyes, artificial fragrances and animal by-products which go right into the air you breathe. But she did not want to get rid of her beloved candles and the beautiful glow that made her so happy. Several years of research revealed that coconut wax candles with a blend of essential oils, natural cotton wicks, and recyclable glass containers is the best combination. She started by making her own candles in her kitchen and selling them to family and friends. It took off from there. Her unique recipe suddenly became in high demand, and the companyâ€™s message grew. Now, her candles are in homes all across America.</p>

  <h2>What We Are Made Of</h2>
  <p>We work with farmers that are dedicated to incorporating green technology, including using less water for plant growth, utilizing solar panels, and encouraging the use of fuels that reduce their carbon output. You will not find any animal byproducts, petroleum, or artificial scents in our candles or process. Every single candle is vegan, natural, sustainable, and eco-friendly. Our main ingredient is organic coconut wax. Our process involves gathering the coconut meat and cold pressing its oil. Using the hydrogenation process, coconut oil is then transformed into wax. Coconut wax burns a lot cleaner, cooler and perfectly complements many kinds of essential oils.</p>
